# Sustainable Coding

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act but a habit. - Aristotle

This document describes my ever-evolving perspective on the strive for excellence as a software developer. Its focus is on the act of writing code, more than code itself. Even though the act of creation and the thing created are intimately related, I consider improvements made in a software developer's mindset to be more important than improvements made in a source code file.

I chose the title 'Sustainable Coding' to reflect this ambition. Here's whyâ€¦

**Sustainable**

Despite the current buzzword status of *sustainable* I could not find a better adjective to describe my objective. Two definitions of [sustainable](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/sustainable) from Oxford Dictionary are:
- Able to be maintained at a certain rate or level
- Able to be upheld or defended

These definitions provide the raw material for a professional software developer's creed: 

> I develop high-quality software that can be maintained at a reliable rate, using only practices which I am willing to uphold and defend.

**Coding**

I chose the verb *coding* instead of the noun *code* as the second word of the title to emphasize my focus on writing code more than the code that is written. It might be a subtle distinction, but it is an important one.

##Fixing bugs
Give each bug fix its due diligence, otherwise your fix will likely create more bugs.

Fix the problem, not a symptom.

Decide how to fix a bug only once you understand what causes it.

If you can't explain why your fix works, it is not a valid fix.
